CVE-2021-4034 Proof of Concept
==============================

How to:

1. Get a vulnerable version of `pkexec` e.g. from `policykit-1 <= 0.105-31` in
   the [Debian repos][polkit-debian] or even built [from source][polkit-source].
   You can  have it locally installed or just copy get the `pkexec` executable
   alone directly in this directory.
2. Ensure you have GCC installed in order to compile the two C helpers in this
   repo.
3. Run `./expl.sh` and enjoy.

**NOTE**: `expl.sh` will first look for `pkexec` in the current working directory,
then fall-back to `$PATH`. Since `pkexec` is usually a setuid-root executable,
maybe run this in a VM and not on your machine, y'know...
